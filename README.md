Learning all about using Hibernate with Spring Boot.
--------------------------------------------------------

Need the same requirements as before, with the addition of MySQL Workbench.

After installing MySQL workbench, run the first script in starter-sql-scripts in your root instance of MySQL Workbench.

Leave root and go to the springstudent instance where the password will also be springstudent.

Now, run the second script in starter-sql-scripts to create the database.
